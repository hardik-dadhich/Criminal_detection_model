# Criminal_detection_model
## Hackathon 4.0 
Problem Statement:
With the rapid urbanization and development of cities, the Graph
of crimes also increase rapidly. Also many time the criminal were
not in the hands of police due to less of evidence or wasting too
much time in investigation. There is several data I am showing

Reporting of Crimes: According to a report by Times of India.
Many criminals or serial killer leaves the clue of letter or
handwriting by mistake. So our detectives of Expert forensic
analysts closely examine individual characteristics on a
microscopic level to identify criminals and verify document
manually. This cause time wasting or provide more time to
criminal to walk away.

## dependences of model 
Python 3.x || 2.7 for PIL support<br/>
OpenCV 3 <br/>
PIL(python imagining library)<br/>
MNIST dataset(nodigit.png) : included<br/>

## how to run this model
simply run digitreader.py and press space baar because it will detect till contour edges.
output will be detected digit handwriting
